Instead, we first braid the middle strand and mess it up for more volume. Then begin regularly braiding with the three strands, using the middle braid as the middle strand. Tie off the braid with an elastic and mess it up for even more volume. Hope you like it ! Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel :)",

I got so many sweet comments asking me to redo it as a tutorial- so here we go :) ! First off, if you have curly hair- perfect ! You can skip the curling hair part. If you have wavy/straight hair, I totally suggest using the conair infiniti clipless curling wand that I used. I would highly recommend investing in it (about $30 from walmart/target/beautystores). I bought mine about a year ago and use it all the time. It turns straight hair into super curly ringlets. And I use it on my naturally curly hair too when I need a little more spring/bounce. ",
