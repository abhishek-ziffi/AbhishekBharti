Tie off the braid with an elastic and mess it up for even more volume. Hope you like it ! Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel :)",

I got so many sweet comments asking me to redo it as a tutorial- so here we go :) ! First off, if you have curly hair- perfect ! You can skip the curling hair part. If you have wavy/straight hair, I totally suggest using the conair infiniti clipless curling wand that I used. I would highly recommend investing in it (about $30 from walmart/target/beautystores). I bought mine about a year ago and use it all the time. It turns straight hair into super curly ringlets. And I use it on my naturally curly hair too when I need a little more spring/bounce. ",

This is a super quick, easy way to get your hair up ! You only need a pencil to twist your hair up into a loose updo. I have some short layers that stick out (from my new haircut!), which adds to the undone-ness effect. I used to do this all the time in college ! It's perfect for when you forget elastics, rubberbands, or bobbypins ! This may only work on medium to thin hair like mine but give it a try anyways and let me know :)",

Hi guys ! I wanted to take a simple side braid hairstyle and add a little fun to it. I tried a few different ways to do this beaded look. When I braided the pearls into my hair (by combining it into a strand of hair), you couldn't even see the pearls. As I braided it, the pearls got lost in the hair. So I'm really happy with the way it turned out using my technique. One being because I only needed to use one hair elastic. And two being that my braid looked more loose, which I like :) Hope you like this hair style and try it out for yourselves ! ",

I have gotten lots of questions if these extensions are still working for me and if they are still in good quality. Yes ! They are ! These extensions are my favorite and I absolutely love the Luxy Sisters who sell them :) I was sponsored these extensions a year or so ago. I never got the chance to wear them more than 3 or 4 times because I kept dying my hair too dark :( So my hair finally matches now !
