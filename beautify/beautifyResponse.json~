Tie off the braid with an elastic and mess it up for even more volume. Hope you like it ! Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe to my channel :)",

I got so many sweet comments asking me to redo it as a tutorial- so here we go :) ! First off, if you have curly hair- perfect ! You can skip the curling hair part. If you have wavy/straight hair, I totally suggest using the conair infiniti clipless curling wand that I used. I would highly recommend investing in it (about $30 from walmart/target/beautystores). I bought mine about a year ago and use it all the time. It turns straight hair into super curly ringlets. And I use it on my naturally curly hair too when I need a little more spring/bounce. ",

This is a super quick, easy way to get your hair up ! You only need a pencil to twist your hair up into a loose updo. I have some short layers that stick out (from my new haircut!), which adds to the undone-ness effect. I used to do this all the time in college ! It's perfect for when you forget elastics, rubberbands, or bobbypins ! This may only work on medium to thin hair like mine but give it a try anyways and let me know :)",

Hi guys ! I wanted to take a simple side braid hairstyle and add a little fun to it. I tried a few different ways to do this beaded look. When I braided the pearls into my hair (by combining it into a strand of hair), you couldn't even see the pearls. As I braided it, the pearls got lost in the hair. So I'm really happy with the way it turned out using my technique. One being because I only needed to use one hair elastic. And two being that my braid looked more loose, which I like :) Hope you like this hair style and try it out for yourselves ! ",

I have gotten lots of questions if these extensions are still working for me and if they are still in good quality. Yes ! They are ! These extensions are my favorite and I absolutely love the Luxy Sisters who sell them :) I was sponsored these extensions a year or so ago. I never got the chance to wear them more than 3 or 4 times because I kept dying my hair too dark :( So my hair finally matches now !

A minefield of the make-up world, contouring is something that can go badly wrong. This video is an introduction to the basic principles of shading and contouring the face with powder. Good contouring can make a wide face appear narrower and cheekbones appear more prominent. It can also help to define the jawline and lift the eyes. All this needs to be done with a light touch using the right product and shade, especially for a daytime look. Once you have mastered the very basic techniques shown here you can build up your skills and really make the most of your bone structure and the shape of your face.",

Fake lashes are everywhere right now, the major eyelash brands are making some incredible designs and lash bars are popping up all over town. No amount of mascara will ever give you the very dramatic effect of strip lashes. Although a little trickier to apply to yourself than individuals (in my opinion), it definitely worth having a go for a special night out as they can completely transform your eyes and give your make-up a totally different feel. Choose your lashes according to whats going to suit your eye shape and face best. If you really look after your lashes (clean off mascara with gentle remover after every use) and put them away properly in the box they came in, you can use them time and time again. Remove them as you would individuals by soaking a cotton wool disc in eye make-up remover and holding it flat over your eye for several seconds. This should soften the glue and loosen the lashes. Repeat if necessary.",

Individual lashes give a very different feel to strip lashes because they are less uniform so the effect is more random, feathery and natural looking. You can achieve different effects depending on how many you apply and which lengths you use. I love using them on my clients and myself and hope these application tips will inspire you to give them a go too. To remove, soak a cotton wool pad in eye make-up remover and hold flat over your eye firmly for several seconds. The remover will loosen and dissolve the glue. Repeat if necessary and then continue with the rest of your cleansing routine. ",

This is one of my signature looks. I've done it hundreds of times for models and actresses for shoots and events and I occasionally wear it myself. It can be a great minimal chic look for day or work equally well as a glamorous sexy look for evenings. You can play around with the thickness of the line to create a different feel and experiment with the colour. It takes a bit of practice to do it on yourself but its definitely worth the effort - its a great modern classic!",

It's that 'back to school' time of year again so lets get our pencil cases (make-up bags!) clean and sorted. The best thing to do to look like an effortless beauty on a daily basis is to get organised.

I'm suggesting 7 categories of essentail, staple items that are useful for every womans capsule make-up kit. Whether you need one or more item from each category (or none from some!) depends on your skin and the type of look you usually do. Carrying a huge selection of random make-up and lots of identical dupes in your make-up bad will not only slow your routine down it'll give you a bad back! Hope this was helpful X",

I've had so many requests for smokey eye make-up for hooded eyes of all ages so I thought I would do this look. Don't forget, a hooded eye shape is not a 'problem' its just another shape as beautiful as all other. Hope it's helpful X

Special thanks to Stacha for modelling for me! Stacha has written a few thoughts and has asked me to place them here:
'I sit in the chair trying to keep my back straight so the camera always has the perfect shot. My wild curls scrapped back to ensure we have perfect lighting. I am tired from the previous days migraine. I listen to Lisa say her viewers like questions, the camera roles and the dutiful actor begins her work. I feel more vulnerable than I expected, but I am happy to be of service.

Later I would read the comments and for the first time in my life question if I was beautiful, it had never occurred to me. I had always felt beautiful. Everyone who has ever loved me told me I was beautiful, so I was in no doubt I was beautiful, as in fact most people I have ever met are beautiful and I am not just talking souls.

What the media reflects as beauty and what actually is are two different things, very different, especially as what the media reflects is not actually real. It does not exist. That is what I hoped doing this video would convey. If you had met Kate Moss without her make up as I have more than on one occasion, you would see we are the same age. She is still beautiful, just different. Not unlike you. We all have great days and bad days with and without make up.

A photograph is often a cheap imitation of woman, it should never be the other way round. Did I cry, of course not, I am blessed with a strong understanding of my worth. 

We have so many aspects to us as woman, there are days we are Goddesses, Fiery Hell Maidens, The Dark Temptress, The Innocent Girl, The Wise Crone, etc and all of these we enjoy playing with. We play with them with whatever means are that are available to us, make up, clothes, hair, music, scents and anything else that fires our imagination, if we can find a way to express whats inside us at that time we will will, for we are a creative bunch. However I also know that during some of my most difficult times, with none of these things available and the world against me that I am, magnificent, as many other wonderful beautiful woman I know.

We are each and everyone of us so much more than a before and after photo as the wisest woman in us all knows there is no such thing.'
